Hello there, I'm Stella a.k.a Akosua Akimbo. Nice to meet you. Did you enjoy my writting? 
I love writing and I love solving problems as well so I thought I'd put the two together.
Reach out to me if you have any writing tips or interesting problem solving techniques or anything else.
Always excited to make new friends.

Stay safe!
