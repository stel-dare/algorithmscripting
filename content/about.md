Hi, I'm Stella. I was recently doing [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) JavaScript challenges. Some of the mathematical concepts were a bit diificult to grasp so I had to look for posts on the web that explained them. Most of the posts I found although were very good articles still couldn't make me understand. 

Eventually I understood the concepts and decided to start a blog that explained things from my point of view. In this way I would be helping people who are experiencing what I experienced and also be documenting my progress.

Thank you for passing by. I hope my post was able to help you. Your suggestions are warmly welcomed.
